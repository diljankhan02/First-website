    <h1>
        Milky Way
    </h1>
    <p>
        The Milky Way is our galaxy, a huge group of stars, planets, and dust held by gravity. On clear nights, it looks 
        like a faint white band across the sky. Our solar system is a tiny part of this giant galaxy, which has billions of stars 
        and stretches so wide that light takes 100,000 years to cross it.

    <h2>
        Stargazing
    </h2>
    <p>
        Stargazing is the simple joy of looking at stars in the night sky. We can see twinkling stars, planets, and  even the Milky Way. 
        It is a peaceful way to feel connected to the universe and admire its vast beauty. The more we learn, the more magical the 
        night sky becomes.
